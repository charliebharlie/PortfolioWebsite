  As a lifeguard at <span class = "red">Great America</span>, I was responsible for ensuring the
  safety of swimmers. I underwent training and
  successfully passed written and physical tests which prepared me with quick response skills
  to identify potential risks and prevent accidents. I acquired essential life-saving skills,
  including CPR and how to treat spinal injuries in water, ensuring I can respond promptly to
  emergencies. Additionally, I am trained to assist individuals with choking, equipped to handle
  critical situations and provide aid when needed, making safety my top priority. With vigilance
  and professionalism, I enforce pool and beach rules, providing a safe and enjoyable environment
  for all visitors. As a lifeguard, I serve as a trusted guardian, ready to respond to
  emergencies and save lives if necessary.
